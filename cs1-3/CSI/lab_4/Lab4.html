<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The assignment contains two parts.

<ol>
<li><b>Scientific calculator.</b>  Study tracking changes and
  automatic indentation in MSVS
  <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/MSVS/features.html">described here</a>. As you program
  your project below, demonstrate to the lab instructor 
  applying automatic indentation to your code.
  <p>

  Study <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab4/math_library_functions.html">these functions</a> of the
  math library. Create a project titled <samp>Lab4_Calculator</samp>
  with a single file titled <samp>calculator.cpp</samp>. Write a
  program that: </p><ul>
  <li> prints a numbered menu of mathematical operations as shown below;
  </li><li> then prompts the user to select an operation;
  </li><li> then prompts and inputs the operands for the selected option (note that
  some operations require one and some two operands);
  </li><li>  then computes  and outputs the result. 
  </li></ul>
  The process repeats. The program should quit if the user inputs an
  option (number) that is not listed. The dialog should look as
  follows:

<pre>1. absolute value
2. square root
3. ceiling
4. power
Select an operation:  4
Enter base: 2
Enter exponent: 3
The result is: 8
Select an operation: 
...
</pre>

</li><li><b>Guessing game.</b>  

  Create a project titled <samp>Lab4_Guess</samp> with a single file
  titled <samp>guess.cpp</samp> Program the following game. The
  computer selects a random number between 0 and 99 and asks the user
  to guess the number. If the user guesses incorrectly, the computer
  states whether the selected number is smaller or greater than the
  guess. The guessing repeats until the user guesses the number. The
  dialog should look as follows:

  <pre>  I selected a number between 0 and 99, what is it?    30
  wrong, it is larger, what is it?   60
  wrong, it is smaller, what is it?  50
  wrong, it is larger, what is it?   55
  wrong, it is smaller, what is it?  53
  correct!
  </pre>

  For your program you need to use predefined randomization
  functions <samp>rand()</samp> and <samp>srand()</samp> as well as
  the time function <samp>time()</samp>

  <p>
  </p><ul>
  <li>Function <samp>time()</samp> returns current time (as kept by
    the computer) in the number of seconds passed since midnight,
    January 1, 1970.  You need to include <samp>ctime</samp> to use
    this function. The function takes one argument but for this
    assignment the argument value is a special named
    constant <samp>nullptr</samp>. Check <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab4/time.cpp">this
    program</a> for an example usage.
  <p>
  </p></li><li> To use functions <samp>rand()</samp> and <samp>srand()</samp>
       you need to include <samp>cstdlib</samp>
       Function <samp>srand()</samp> initializes the random number
       generator of the program. It takes a single integer
       argument. The value passed to <samp>srand()</samp> determines
       the values output by <samp>rand()</samp>. This value is
       called <i>seed</i>.
       <p>
       <samp>rand()</samp> takes no arguments. Every
       time <samp>rand()</samp> is invoked it returns an integer value between
       0 and constant RAND_MAX defined in <samp>cstdlib</samp>. Note
       that the sequence of values returned by repeated calls
       of <samp>rand()</samp> is uniquely determined by the seed
       passed to <samp>srand()</samp>. That is,
       if <samp>srand()</samp> is passed the same
       seed, <samp>rand()</samp> is going to return the same sequence
       of numbers. This is helpful for
       debugging. Check <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab4/random.cpp">this program</a> for an
       example of random number manipulation.
  </p></li></ul>

  <b>Hints:</b> Use fixed values of the seed for your initial
  debugging, use the output of <samp>time()</samp> as an unpredictable
  seed to start the guessing game once you debugged your program.
  <p>
  Note that random value produced by <samp>rand()</samp> is out of the
  required range of 0-99. Use just the last two digits of the
  number. To get them, compute the remainder of the division by 100 of
  the number returned by <samp>rand()</samp>
  </p><p>
  Do not put <samp>srand()</samp> inside the loop or anywhere, where it
  may be invoked more than once - it resets the random number generator.
</p></li></ol>

Make sure your program adheres to proper programming style. Submit your
project to the subversion repository.  Do not forget to verify your
submission on the web.
