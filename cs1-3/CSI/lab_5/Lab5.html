<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The assignment contains two parts.

<ol>
<li><b>Basal Metabolic Rate.</b> Study "Observing Program Stack"
  <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/MSVS/debugging.html">described here</a>.  As you program
  your project below, demonstrate to the lab instructor observing
  variables local to several function frames.
  <p>

  Create a project titled <samp>Lab5_BMR</samp> with a single file
  titled <samp>bmr.cpp</samp> The program should calculate the
  person's Basal Metabolic Rate - the number of calories per day a
  person's body needs to function. Then, on the basis of calculated
  BMR, your program should output how many doughnuts a person can
  consume. A medium-size doughnut contains 195 calories. 

  

  </p><p>
  The BMR formula is as follows:
  </p><ul>
  <li>for women:
  <pre>  655 + (4.3 x weight in pounds) + (4.7 x height in inches) - (4.7 x age in years)
  </pre>
  </li><li>for men:
  <pre>  66 + (6.3 x weight in pounds) + (12.9 x height in inches) - (6.8 x age in years)
  </pre>
  </li></ul>
  <p>Depending on gender, BMR should be calculated by
     functions <samp>bmrWomen()</samp> and <samp>bmrMen()</samp> that
     both accept three parameters: "weight in pounds", "height in
     inches" and "age in years" and return the BMR. Note that the BMR
     has a fractional part.
  </p><p>
     The main function should prompt the user for her gender, weight,
     height and age; compute the BMR and the number of doughnuts that
     can be consumed per day; and then output both the BMR and the
     number doughnuts.

  </p><p> The number of doughnuts is: BMR divided by the number of calories
     in a doughnut. Fractional number of doughnuts can be dropped. The
     number of calories per doughnut (195) should be put in a named
     constant.

   </p><p>
     On the basis of the user's gender, <smap>main() function
     should decide whether to invoke <samp>bmrWomen()</samp> or
     <samp>bmrMen()</samp>.  The user should input her height in feet
     and inches. The <samp>main()</samp> function should compute the
     total number of inches (one foot has 12 inches) and pass it to
     the <samp>bmr</samp> functions.

  </smap></p><p> Make sure to use the bmr function prototypes and put the function
     definitions below the main function definition.

  
</p></li><li><b>Figures.</b> Create a project
titled <samp>Lab5_Figures</samp>. This project shall contain multiple
files. Write a program that repeatedly asks the user to select either
square, left or right triangle, then inputs the figure size and then
prints the appropriate shape in stars. For square, the program should
ask whether the user wants a filled or a hollow square.  The program
should quit if the user inputs an invalid option. See an example
dialog below:

<pre>1. square
2. bottom left triangle
3. top right triangle
select figure: 1
select size: 4
filled or hollow [f/h]: h
****
*  *
*  *
****
1. square
2. bottom left triangle
3. top right triangle
...
</pre>

<p> You can reuse your code from the Looping lab.  Place the
star-printing code in four separate functions:
<samp>filledSquare</samp>, <samp>hollowSquare</samp>,
<samp>leftTriangle</samp> and <samp>rightTriangle</samp>. Each
function should accept a single integer parameter - the size of the
figure and return no value (be a void-function). Create three separate
files <samp>figures.cpp</samp>, <samp>figures.h</samp>, and
<samp>figuresInput.cpp</samp>. Place the triangle and square function
definitions in <samp>figures.cpp</samp> and their prototypes in
<samp>figures.h</samp>. Make sure that the header file is protected
against multiple inclusion.  Place the main function in
<samp>figuresInput.cpp</samp> </p></li></ol>

Make sure your programs adhere to proper programming style. Submit
your projects to the subversion repository.  Do not forget to verify
your submission on the web.
