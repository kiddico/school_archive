You are free to use a single or multiple files for this project. If you
are putting all functions in a single file, make sure that more
abstract functions are defined first.
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><b>Mini-sort with functions.</b>  Create a project
    titled <samp>Lab6_Swap</samp>. Revisit <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab6/sort.cpp">this
    program</a> from one of the earlier lab assignments that sorts
    three numbers in the increasing order. Modify it so that it
    invokes a function to swap the values of two variables. You should
    use the swapping function from <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab6/swapem.cpp">this
    program</a>. The pseudocde for the
    <samp>main()</samp> function is as follows:
    <pre>      input three numbers
      if first number is greater than second 
          invoke the swap function to swap first and second numbers
      if first is greater than third 
          invoke the swap function to swap first and third numbers
      if second is greater than third
          invoke the swap function to swap second and third numbers
      output three sorted numbers
    </pre>

</li><li>

<p>
<b>Lottery.</b> In this assignment you are to code a program that
selects 10 random non-repeating positive numbers (the lottery
numbers), takes a single input from the user and checks the input with
the ten lottery numbers. The user wins if her input matches one of the
lottery numbers.
</p><p>

Study displaying arrays in functions
<a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/MSVS/debugging.html">described here</a>.  As you program
your project, demonstrate to the lab instructor displaying an array
passed to a function.  Create a project
titled <samp>Lab6_Lottery</samp>.  Declare an array <samp>wins</samp>
of 10 integer elements.
</p><p>
Define the following functions:

</p><ul>
<li>Define function <samp>initialize()</samp> that takes
array <samp>wins[]</samp> as a parameter and assigns <samp>-1</samp> to
each element of the array.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> Array elements are initialized to <smap>-1, which
is outside of lottery numbers' range, to distinguish elements that have not
been given lottery numbers yet.
</smap></p><p>
Passing an array as a parameter and its initialization is
done similar to the code in <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab6/3fillUp.cpp">this program</a>.
</p><p>
</p></li><li>Define a function <samp>check()</samp> that takes a number and the
array <samp>wins[]</samp> as parameters and returns <samp>true</samp>
if the number matches one of the elements in the
array, or <samp>false</samp> if none of the elements do. That is, in the
function, you should write the code that iterates over the array
looking for the number passed as the parameter. You may assume that
the number that <samp>check()</samp> is looking for is always positive.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> Looking for the match is similar to looking for the
minimum number in <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab6/1fixedarray.cpp">this program</a>.  

</p><p>
</p></li><li>Define a function <samp>draw()</samp> that takes array <samp>wins</samp>
as a parameter and fills it with 10 random integers whose values are
from 0 to 99. The numbers should <u>not</u> repeat.
<p>
<b>Hint:</b> Use <samp>srand()</samp>, <samp>rand()</samp>
and <samp>time()</samp> functions that we studied earlier to generate
appropriate random numbers from 0 to 99 and fill the array. Before the
selected number is entered into the array <samp>wins</samp>, call
function <samp>check()</samp> to make sure that the new number is not
already in the array. If it is already there, select another number.
</p><p>
The pseudocode for your <samp>draw()</samp> function may be as follows:
  </p><pre>    declare a variable "number of selected lottery numbers so far",
                 initialize this variable to zero
    while (the_number_of_selected_elements is less than the array size)
         select a new random number
         call check() to see if this new random number is already in the array
         if the new random number is not in the array
             increment the number of selected elements
             add the newly selected element to the array

   </pre>
<p>
</p></li><li> 
  Define function <samp>entry()</samp> that asks the user to enter a
  single number from 0 to 99 and returns this value.

<p>
</p></li><li>Define function <samp>printOut()</samp> that outputs the
  selected numbers and user input.<br>
 <b>Hint:</b> Outputting the array can be done similar to
  echoing it in <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/csi/Labs/Lab6/3fillUp.cpp">this program</a>.
</li></ul>
<p>
The pseudocode your function <samp>main()</samp> should be as
follows:

  </p><pre>  main(){
      declare array and other variables
  
      initialize(...) // fill array with -1
      draw(...)       // select 10 non-repeating random numbers
      entry(...)      // get user input
      use check () to compare user input against lottery numbers
      and output whether user won
      printOut(...)   // outputs seleced lottery numbers
  }
  </pre>


<p>
  <b>Note:</b> A program that processes each element of the array
  separately (i.e. accesses all 10 elements of the array for
  assignment or comparison outside a loop) is inefficient and will
  result in a poor grade.
  </p><p>
 <b>Note 2:</b> For your project, you should either pass the array
 size (10) to the functions as a parameter or use a global constant to
 store it. Hard-coding the literal constant <samp>10</samp> in
 function definitions that receive the array as a parameter is poor
 style. It should be avoided.
