<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The project is due in one week. Specifically, it is due by the
midnight on the day of the next lab.
<p>
<!--
The assignment contains two parts. Implement both parts using
procedural programming techniques only. That is, you are not allowed to
define classes or declare objects.

Implement the lab using procedural programming techniques only. That
is, you are not allowed to define classes or objects.

</p><p>
<b>Diff.</b>  Implement a program that compares two text files
character-by-character. The program should output the line numbers
that contain different characters and the place where the two lines
start to differ (the difference is denoted by ^ (caret) character. If
both files are identical, the program should output nothing. If one
file is shorter than the other, the shorter file is assumed to have
empty lines, i.e. the extra lines of the longer file are considered
different from the empty lines of the shorter file.
</p><p>
The file names should be passed as arguments on the command
line. Assume the two file names are the same length. Assume the files
exist. If your program is invoked with different number of arguments,
print help message and quit. The program operation should look like
this:
</p><pre>	prompt% diff file1.txt file2.txt

	file1.txt: 20: Hello
	file2.txt: 20: Hallo
                        ^
	file1.txt: 25: World????
	file2.txt: 25: World!
                            ^
</pre>
where 20 and 25 are line numbers.
<p>
You are allowed to use <samp>getline()</samp> and string comparison
functions in the implementation of this project.
<!--
<p>
<li><b>Cipher.</b>  Implement a program that executes so-called Cesar
cipher. The program should read the source file
character-by-character, add the specified key to each character and
output the encoded program into target file. Only alphabetic
characters need to be encoded (use <samp>isalpha()</samp> function).
The key should be taken modulo 26.

The key, source and target file names are specified on the command
line. That is, the invocation of the program is as follows:
<pre>
	prompt% cipher 2 source.txt target.txt
</pre>
Note that to reverse the encoding, the program should be executed with
matching negative key:
<pre>
        prompt% cipher -2 target.txt source.txt
</pre>
To check the operation of your program, encode then decode the same
file and compare the difference between the original and decoded files
using diff (implemented in the first part of the assignment).

<p>
<b>Hints</b>.
<p>
You can use <samp>atoi()</samp> function to convert from string to
integer to get the key from the command line argument. See example
<a href=toInt.cpp>here</a>.
<p>
Use <samp>isupper()</samp> or <samp>islower()</samp> to distinguish
upper/lower cases of letters.

To configure command-line arguments for an MS Visual Studio project,
right-click Solution Explorer, select "properties" from the drop-down
menu, go to Configuration Properties  Debugging and set "Command
Arguments" in the properties list.
-->

</p><p><b>Hint</b>.
The command line arguments are input as C-style strings
arguments to <samp>main()</samp>. <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Labs/commandLine.cpp">See this
program</a> for an example of handling them.

</p><p>
To create a string of spaces of a particular <samp>length</samp> use this form of initialization:
<samp>string spaceString(length, ' ');</samp>, or
use <samp>assign</samp> operator: <samp>spaceString.assign(length, '
');</samp>

<!--
Consider using <samp>str.compare()</samp> for string
comparison. See <a href=strCompare.cpp>this program</a> for example
usage.
