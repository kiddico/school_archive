Implement a program that compares two text files character-by-character.
The program should output the line numbers that contain different characters and the place where the two lines start to differ (the difference is denoted by ^ (caret) character.
If both files are identical, the program should output nothing.
If one file is shorter than the other, the shorter file is assumed to have empty lines, i.e. the extra lines of the longer file are considered different from the empty lines of the shorter file.
If one file is shorter than the other, the shorter file is assumed to have empty lines, i.e. the extra lines of the longer file are considered different from the empty lines of the shorter file.
