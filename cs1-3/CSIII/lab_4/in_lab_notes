Master Roster
First	Last	Course
----------------------
mary	price	cs1
joyce	rod		cs1, cs2

if we see it again in another list, add to end of the list of courses the person is in
(it being the name of the person)

substring to remove the .txt
find_last_of(.txt)
good for stuff like cs1.cs2.txt (aka, assholes)

last point: dropouts.

any # of input files.
last file can be assumed to be a dropout files, filled with people to remove, and not include in the master list at all. no matter how many courses she's in.
