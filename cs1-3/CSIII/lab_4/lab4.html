<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next
lab. Make sure to include your name in comments of the source
files.

<p>
Recode the
<a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Examples/STLContainersSequential/Roster">roster</a>
example we studied in class such that the list of classes the student
is enrolled in is output next to student name.
</p><p>
<!--
The container of the student roster should be modified as follows: the
vector should contain student entries. Each entry is a linked list
where the first entry is a first (or last) name, followed by the
entries of the courses the student is enrolled in. That is, the
structure hodling student entries should
be: <samp>vector&ltlist&ltstring&gt&gt studentEntries</samp> or
    <samp>list&ltlist&ltstring&gt&gt studentEntries</samp>

Assume that students all have different last names.
<p>
--> The printed out list may be tab-separated.  You may assume that
the text file structure is: one name per line; the line contains a
first name followed by last name separated by white space. Each
student has exactly two names: first and last. The course name is the
file name without the extension. The dropouts file is always the last file in the list and its name is always <samp>dropouts.txt</samp>
</p><p>
Here is an example of a printout:
</p><pre>All Students
first name   last name  courses enrolled 
Kathleen    Anderson CS1   CS3
Gerald   Edwards  CS1   CS2 CS3
Mary    Price    CS1
...
</pre>
<p>
You may not use associative containers: only vectors and lists.

</p><p><b>Hint:</b> after compiling the mater list of enrolled students,
use <samp>find()</samp> function of <samp>list</samp> container to
check if the student name is present in each roster.

<!--
<ul>
<li>Create a function that swaps first and last names for
input and processing.


<li>Use extraction operator to input tokens (words) and strip the
whitespace. If you still want to use <samp>getline()</samp>, you can
then tokenize a string by treating a string as a stream and using an
extraction operator on this stream. <a href=tokenize.cpp>Here</a> is
an example tokenzing program that works on <a href=test.txt>this</a>
text file.
