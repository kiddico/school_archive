<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next
lab. Make sure to include your name in comments of the source
files.

<p>
Recode the previous lab assignment using associative
containers. Specifically, you need to use a map keyed by the student's
last name and their first name, the map value may be the list of
courses the student is enrolled in. The map should be the ordered map.
That is, the data structure to be used in as
follows: <samp>map&lt;string, list&lt;string&gt;&gt; studentEntries</samp>;

</p><p>
To repeat, you need to recode the
<a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Examples/STLContainersSequential/Roster">roster</a>
example we studied in class such that the students are sorted
according to their last names and a list of classes the student
enrolled in is printed by the student's name. The list may be
tab-separated. In the printouts, the student's last name should be
stated first.  You may assume that the text file structure is: one
name per line; the line contains a first name followed by last name
separated by white space. Each student has exactly two names: first
and last. There may be students with the same last name. But there
cannot be two sudents with exactly the same first and last name.

Here is an example of a printout:
</p><pre>All Students
last name, first name:  courses enrolled 
Anderson, Kathleen: CS1   CS3  CS4
Edwards, Gerald: CS1   CS2 CS3
Price, Mary: CS1
...
</pre>
