<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next
lab. Make sure to include your name in comments of the source
files.
<p>
Modify the
<a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Examples/TemplateIntro/ListTemplate/">
list template example</a> as follows. Create a new templated
class <samp>Collection</samp> that contains this list as a dynamically
allocated member, i.e, the list contains a pointer to the first
element.  You are not allowed to use STL containers.  The class has to
implement <samp>addItem()</samp>, <samp>removeItem()</samp>, <samp>lastItem()</samp>
and <samp>printCollection()</samp>
methods. Method <samp>lastItem()</samp> should return the last item
added to the collection.
</p><p>
Make sure that your templated list operates correctly with the <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Labs/testCollection.cpp">following code</a>.

</p><p> Templated member functions could be coded inline or
outside. However, either way, they have to be in the header file.
</p><p>
You do not have to code the big three functions (copy constructor,
destructor, overloaded assignment) for your template.
