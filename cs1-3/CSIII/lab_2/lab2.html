<h2>Lab Assignment</h2>

The project is due in one week: by the midnight on the day of the next
lab.

<!--
Implement object-based Cesar Cipher. For that, implement the following
class:
<pre>
class EncodedFile{
public:
      EncodedFile(fileName, key=0); // file name to open and encryption key 
      char next(void); // returns next encoded character
      bool done(void); // end of file reached
private:
      // provide implementation
};
</pre>
<p>
Only alphabetic characters need to be encoded
(hint: <samp>isalpha()</samp> is a good function to use). The rest of
the characters should unencoded. The key is to be used modulo 26. You may expand the interface as you see fit.
<p>
In your <samp>main()</samp>, you should initialize the object of
class <samp>EncodedFile</samp> and then keep
invoking <samp>next()</samp> until end of the file is reached.  -->
<p>

Implement a program that reads in a text file, counts how many times
each word occurs in the file and outputs the words (and counts) in the
decreasing order of occurrence, i.e. the counts need to be output in
sorted order. <i>Word</i> is any sequence of alphanumeric
characters. Whitespace and punctuation marks are to be discarded. That
is, the punctuation marks should not be counted either as a part of
the word or as a separate word.  You are free to make your program
case sensitive (<samp>Hello</samp> and <samp>hello</samp> are counted
as separate words) or case insensitive. File name is supplied on
command line. You are to use the following classes.


</p><pre>class WordOccurrence {
public:
    WordOccurrence(const string&amp; word="", int num=0);
    bool matchWord(const string &amp;); // returns true if word matches stored
    void increment(); // increments number of occurrences
    string getWord() const; 
    int getNum() const;

private:
    string word_;
    int num_;
};

class WordList{
public:
    // add copy constructor, destructor, overloaded assignment
    void addWord(const string &amp;);
    void printList();
private:
    WordOccurrence *wordArray_; // a dynamically allocated array of WordOccurrences
                                // may or may not be sorted
    int size_;
};

</pre>


Using vectors is not allowed.  You may use standard sorting algorithms
or implement insertion sort form scratch.  For the second class
(<samp>WordList</samp>), implement a copy constructor (implementing
deep copy), destructor and an overloaded assignment (either classical
or copy-and-swap).  Make sure your class works correctly with
the <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Labs/testWordList.cpp">following code</a>.
For your constructors, use member initialization lists where possible,
use default values for function parameters where appropriate. Enhance
class interface if necessary.



<p>
<b>Hint:</b> you can use <samp>ctype</samp> functions to check if a character is alphanumeric. <a href="http://vega.cs.kent.edu/~mikhail/classes/cs3/Labs/ctypedemo.cpp">Here</a> is an example use.
