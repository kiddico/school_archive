# Code-Repo
I used to have this hosted on my site, but it makes a lot more sense to do it like this instead.

### A note to academic administration and comments on licensing:
I only ever commit after the due date of projects for the class I'm currently attending. After it's been put up here it's absolutely free game. Redistribution, changes, and personal use is allowed. Do what ya gotta do.

###A note to students to whom these things may be of use:
Don't be stupid, stupid.


#### To read html...
Prepend the url to the blob with "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?".
For example, to view the instructions for lab 3 in CSI go to the url:
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kiddico/Code-Repo/blob/master/cs123/CSI/lab_3/Lab3.html
