# School labs and projects - KSU
I used to have this hosted on my site, but it makes a lot more sense to do it like this instead.

### A note to academic administration and comments on licensing:
I only ever commit after the due date of projects for the class I'm currently attending. After it's been put up here it's absolutely free game. Changes and redistribution for non-commercial use is allowed. Do what ya gotta do.

###A note to students to whom these things may be of use:
Don't be stupid, stupid.


#### To read html...
Prepend the url to the blob with "http://htmlpreview.github.io/?".
For example, to view the instructions for lab 3 in CSI go to the url:
http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kiddico/Code-Repo/blob/master/cs123/CSI/lab_3/Lab3.html

##### For anyone learning c++ this may be useful ;P
